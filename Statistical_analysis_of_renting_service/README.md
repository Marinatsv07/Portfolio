# Statistical Analysis of GoFast Scooter Rentals

## Project Description
This project involves analyzing the trips of GoFast scooter rental service users across different cities. The dataset provided contains information about certain users from multiple cities, as well as details about their trips. The objective is to analyze this data and test several hypotheses that could help the business grow. GoFast allows users to make city trips using its mobile application, with different pricing models for subscribed and non-subscribed users. The service can be used without a subscription, where there is no subscription fee, the cost per minute of the ride is 8 rubles, and the start cost is 50 rubles. With the Ultra subscription, the monthly fee is 199 rubles, the cost per minute is 6 rubles, and the start cost is free.

## Data Description
The primary data includes information about users, their trips, and subscriptions.
- Users: `users_go.csv`
- Trips: `rides_go.csv`
- Subscriptions: `subscriptions_go.csv`
