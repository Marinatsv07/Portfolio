| #    | Project Name | Project Description | Skills and Tools | Project Insights |
|------|--------------|---------------------|------------------|------------------|
| 1.   | [Churn Prediction for TeleDom Telecom Operator](https://github.com/Marinatsv07/Portfolio/tree/main/Classification_of_TeleDom_churn) | "TeleDom" telecom operator seeks to combat customer churn by offering promo codes and special deals to those planning to discontinue their services. The task is to train a model on collected client data, including tariff and service information, to predict customer churn. | Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Phik, Sklearn, Scipy, CatBoost, LogisticRegression | A classification model was trained to predict customer churn with a ROC_AUC metric of 0.93, surpassing the target of 0.85. |
| 2.   | [Statistical Data Analysis of Mobility Rental Service (Scooters)](https://github.com/Marinatsv07/Portfolio/tree/main/Statistical_analysis_of_renting_service) | Investigate user behavior based on historical data, analyze activity, and test statistical hypotheses on the differences between subscribers and non-subscribers. | Python, Pandas, Numpy, Scipy, Math, Matplotlib, statistical data analysis | User activity was analyzed using MatPlotLib and Seaborn for visualizing behavior patterns. Hypotheses about activity differences between subscribers and non-subscribers were tested using scipy.stats functions. Economic indicators of activity were analyzed to determine optimal service conditions and their potential impact on overall revenue. |
| 3.   | [Customer Photo Processing](https://github.com/Marinatsv07/Portfolio/tree/main/Processing_client_photos) | A retail chain is implementing a computer vision system for processing customer photos. Capturing images at the checkout area will help determine the age of customers to analyze purchases and offer products that might interest customers of that age group, and to monitor the integrity of cashiers when selling alcohol. A model is built to estimate a person's age from their photo. | Python, Keras | Developed a model that estimates a person's approximate age from their photograph. |
| 4.   | [Model for Determining the Cost of a Car](https://github.com/Marinatsv07/Portfolio/tree/main/Reccomendation_system_of_car_price) | A used car sales service is developing an app to attract new clients, allowing them to quickly find out the market value of their car. A model is to be built based on historical data to determine the cost of a car. | Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, sklearn, LightGBM | Developed a recommendation system to estimate a car's price based on its description. |
