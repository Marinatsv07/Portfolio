Determining the age of buyers

Project Description

The Bread-Sol supermarket chain is implementing a computer vision system to process customer photos. Photo recording in the checkout area will help determine the age of customers in order to:

Analyze purchases and offer products that may be of interest to buyers of this age group;

Monitor the integrity of cashiers when selling alcohol. Build a model that will determine the approximate age of a person from a photograph.

Data: a set of photographs of people indicating their age.
